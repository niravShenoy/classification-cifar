1. Please find the best models for each threshold value and variation of the training data in the folder "best_model" under each Task directory
  - These models can be loaded using the commented code in "main.py" of each task which in turn calls "test.py" and returns the logits along with model performance on the datasets. Go through the README of each task to find out how to evaluate the model. 
2. The folder "logs" contain the training and validation performance of the model in each epoch along with the associated graphs
